# Paris-Olympics-2024---Predictions

The script "scrapper.py" was run first to get the csv files from the kaggle website.
Next, the "paris_olympics.py" script was run to hypothesize, clean, and analyze the collected data from which the
new data was transfered to "Top_likely_medalEarners_for2024.csv".

This last file was uploaded to the google.colab website resulting in the following link....

^^^Not malicious, I promise.
Just in case I added a pdf called "paris_olympics_Predictions.ipynb - Colab.pdf" for the final result.

I enjoyed participating in this Hackathon and learned a lot in return.

Thank You.
